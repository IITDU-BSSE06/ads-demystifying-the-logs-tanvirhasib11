I have taken help from http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/writing-an-hadoop-mapreduce-program-in-python/ https://blog.matthewrathbone.com/2016/02/09/python-tutorial.html to learn details about hadoop mapreduce. For the implementation i have visited these sources https://blog.matthewrathbone.com/2016/02/09/python-tutorial.html https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8839389/mapreduce-for-dummies https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8839389/mapreduce-for-dummies . For some tricks i have gone through the site https://amitsealami.github.io/materials/applied_datascience/necessary_commands/. 
MD Habibur Rahman(BSSE 0623) and Feroz Ahmed(BSSE 0618) helped me personally to understand the overall topic.
